# ThreatModellingGame - An Advanced Version

## Description
The Elevation of Privilege (EoP) Card Game for remote teams.
The [original game](http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/adopt/eop.aspx) has been created by Microsoft and is given away by Microsoft at trade shows or other events and as a [PDF download](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20303) of the Adobe Illustrator source files.

The game is designed to draw people who are not security practitioners into the craft of threat modeling. The game uses a variety of techniques to do so in an enticing, supportive and non-threatening way.

For more information I recommend to read [Microsoft's whitepaper](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/A/E/FAE1434F-6D22-4581-9804-8B60C04354E4/EoP_Whitepaper.pdf).

## About this project

### Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to provide remote teams a way to deal the cards and play the game via an online meeting space like Skype, Google Hangouts or whatever technology your team has adopted.

In the first version I am focusing on providing a way of just simply dealing the cards. Other aspects of the game, like modelling the system and writing down the bugs, can be achieved with other online tools and therefore are not required in the first version to be able to play the game.

In later versions I will increasingly add more features to enhance the experience, as well as adding multilingual support.

### Status
The first beta version is available at https://eopgame.azurewebsites.net/
